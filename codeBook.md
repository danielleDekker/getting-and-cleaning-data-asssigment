The data contains measurements on the following variables:

- tBodyAcc-XYZ
- tGravityAcc-XYZ
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- tBodyGyro-XYZ
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAccMag
- tGravityAccMag
- tBodyAccJerkMag
- tBodyGyroMag
- tBodyGyroJerkMag
- fBodyAcc-XYZ
- fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- fBodyGyro-XYZ 
- fBodyAccMag
- fBodyAccJerkMag
- fBodyGyroMag

The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are: 

- Mean and standard deviation (sd)
